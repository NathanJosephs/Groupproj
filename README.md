ðŸ‘€ **Make sure you change branch when making edits as to not over write master branch before we can review things as a group** ðŸ‘€



You can switch/checkout to a different branch either by double-clicking on it under Team Explorer, or by selecting the one from the drop-down menu when you click on the current branch name, 
which can be found in the bottom-right corner of the Visual Studio status bar:

Upon checkout, the selected branch will be highlighted as bold in Team Explorer. Also, the name of the branch, in the bottom-right corner, will change accordingly.
